# password-generatorHW

I have made a password generator where the user can choose different criteria for their desired random password.
There are options for your password, such as having uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
The user may choose however many characters they would like by pressing the up or down arrow in the password length box.
The user may also copy their new password to their clipboard by pressing the pink box next to their newly made password.
